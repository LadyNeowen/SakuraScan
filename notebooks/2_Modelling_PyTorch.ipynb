    "- Train a binary image classifier to distinguish healthy cherry leaves from leaves with powdery mildew.\n",
    "- Use transfer learning with a pretrained CNN (ResNet18) for robust performance.\n",
    "- Save the trained model for use in the SakuraScan Streamlit dashboard.\n",

    "- Image dataset stored in `Data/source_images/healthy` and `Data/source_images/powdery_mildew`.\n",

    "## Outputs\n",
    "- Trained PyTorch model weights saved to `app_pages/src/models/sakuramodel_resnet18.pth`.\n",
    "- Printed training and validation accuracy and loss.\n"
